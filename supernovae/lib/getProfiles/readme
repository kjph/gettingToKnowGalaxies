#=== AIM =======================================================================
To collect the optical profiles of each glxy that hosts a type II SN. Using
these profiles, a transformation is performed to determine the position of the
SN in terms of the semi-major axis (a) and the semi-minor axis (b). We can thus
determine the ellipse that is parallel to (a) and passes through the SN, which
in turn can determine the enclosed flux

#=== TASKS =====================================================================
1. Generate the ssh_CMDFile.sh based on galaxies we are looking for
2. Run the ssh command file to get the paths of the profiles
    $ ssh username@singg.ivec.org < ssh_CMDFile.sh > outputFile.txt
3. Generate the sftp_CMDFile
4. Run the sftp command file to get the profiles
5. Parse the AXERAT, X, Y and POSANGLE
6.
    (see transformation.pdf/tex)
    a. Determine orientation of image
    b. Determine the transformation from RA,DEC --> X,Y (PIXSIZE)
    c. Find the SN center pos in RA,DEC
    d. convert (b) to X,Y
    e. Run the transformation program
        $ python transform.py

[2015-01-02]:	Tutorial on transformation written up in transformation.tex/pdf
[2015-01-07]:   Need to clean up match file to get rid of repeats
                -- Need to select correct GALINDEX from profiles
[2015-01-16]:   J. Removed repeated matches via function in match.py
[2015-01-16]:   Need to contact G. about what to do with different files for the same galaxy
[2015-01-16]:   Need to confirm with G. that galaxies with multiple GALINDices are those with the ":s#" suffix
[2015-01-20]:   Correctly parsed profile for test galaxy in ./test.txt using an updated version of ./parse_glxy_profile.py
[2015-01-20]:   Need to run as batch to get all parameters for each galaxy (first confirm with G. that S# corresponds to galIndex)
[2015-01-20]:   Alex will run conversion on test output and later (maybe) join conversion and parse programs
[2015-01-20]:   Jamie needs to get (RA,DEC) coordinates of SN and Host into output file for conversion program to run
