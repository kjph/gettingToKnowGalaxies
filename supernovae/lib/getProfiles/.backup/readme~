#=== AIM =======================================================================
To collect the optical profiles of each glxy that hosts a type II SN. Using
these profiles, a transformation is performed to determine the position of the
SN in terms of the semi-major axis (a) and the semi-minor axis (b). We can thus
determine the ellipse that is parallel to (a) and passes through the SN, which
in turn can determine the enclosed flux

#=== TASKS =====================================================================
1. Generate the ssh_CMDFile.sh based on galaxies we are looking for
2. Run the ssh command file to get the paths of the profiles
    $ ssh username@singg.ivec.org < ssh_CMDFile.sh > outputFile.txt
3. Generate the sftp_CMDFile
4. Run the sftp command file to get the profiles
5. Parse the AXERAT, X, Y and POSANGLE
6.
    a. Determine orientation of image
    b. Determine the transformation from RA,DEC --> X,Y (PIXSIZE)
    c. Find the SN center pos in RA,DEC
    d. convert (b) to X,Y
    e. Run the transformation program
        $ python transform.py
