Hi Jamie and Alex,

Here are some plot ideas:

1. Plots to see if the SNe hosts are normal compared to all of SINGG
   * Cumulative fractional luminosity histogram of SNe hosts relative to luminosity in Halpha,R compared to the same histogram of all SINGG galaxies
   * we can then do Monte-Carlo sims to see if the hosts we have can be drawn from the SINGG parent sample
   * the idea is that if R or Halpha Luminosity is a fair tracer of the stars from which SNe originate then the SNe should be evenly distributed in fractional luminosity of each tracer
   * This might need a bit better explaining, 
   * and some more data grabbed from the IDL database

2. For each SNe host plot the enclosed Halpha and R flux as a function of semi-major axis
   * Normalize the flux by the total so that the y-axis is from 0 to 1
   * mark the semi-major axis distance to the SN as a vertical line
   * mark where it crosses the curves as horizontal lines
   * store these values of fractional enclosed fluxes

3. Now plot the histograms of fractional enclosed flux at the position of the SNe
   * There should be separate plost for R and Halpha
   * If R and Halpha are good tracers of the source populations of the SNe then the histograms should be evenly distributed between 0 and 1.

Cheers
