Issue in parse.py; output is not correctly writing the values of the profile
parameters, or getting the correct value for semi major length A.

1. ksTest Transform module is causing program to fail the 'try' of line 235-240.
This causes the program to move to the exception of lines 241-243, forcing the
variables 'pp_*' to take a value of -1

2. All galaxies without the identifiers ':s#' do not suspicisouly have profiles.
Please check this. When we check for the identifier, it might be that these
identifier-less galaxies are being ignored

3. We need to check if the correct identifiers are being re-written. All of the
galaxies with identifiers seem to all have gal indexs of 1.
