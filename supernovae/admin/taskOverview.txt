0. Email S. Smartt as to whether it is useful [DONE]

1. We need the up to date list of the SNe matches
    + With Supernova type, position, position uncertainty
    + we should throw out the non core-collapse supernovae
        - keep all type II if spectroscopically confirmed
        - keep all type Ib and type Ic
        - throw out type Ia
        - throw out cases where the spectral type is just a guess
        - throw out cases where the host is a background galaxy
    + following S. Smartt's comments we may also want to impose
        - a distance limit (TBD)
        - an inclination (or axial ratio) limit
    + JAMIE - can you remind me where to find your matched list?

2. For coordinate transformation below we need some info for Each SN host
    + alpha,delta = (RA,Dec) of central peak (in optical and UV)
    + position angle of major axis (in optical and UV)
    + axial ratio (in optical and UV)
    + effective radii in R, Halpha, FUV, NUV

3. Figure out coordinate transformation
    + alpha,delta = (RA,Dec) -> to dx,dy (offset from galaxy centre)
      (alternatively/additionally to i,j pixel position in CCD image)
    + dx,dy -> a, b
    + We want the a value of each SN

4. We need the profile files for the matched list.
    + Jamie has instructions of where to get the optical data

5. These need to be converted to enclosed flux versus a/a_eff

6. We need to average the enclosed flux curve for each band

7. Do the K-S tests
